# I made myself a website

I finally decided to create my own homepage, and here it is. This site is built using my favorite language, F#. Everything is automated through GitHub and based on Markdown content.

When I create a Markdown (.md) file containing a blog post and place it in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MaxGripe/max-gripe-homepage), it is automatically converted to HTML using F# by GitHub and uploaded to Azure. Azure Static Web Apps are available for free, so I'm only paying for the domain name.

If you like this setup, feel free to fork the repository and use it. Soon, I will also develop a dedicated static site generator aimed at minimalist blogging, which will be ready by October 2024 and will hopefully be even simpler to use. The code will be available on GitHub in [this repository](https://github.com/MaxGripe/skunk-html).

For this first blog entry, I'm also including a Markdown formatting cheat sheet below. If you're not too familiar with this markup language, it might be worth taking a look. It's super convenient if you just want to write something without fiddling with HTML, and that's exactly how this site works:

```
# This is heading 1
## This is heading 2
### This is heading 3
#### This is heading 4
##### This is heading 5
###### This is heading 6
```	

# This is heading 1
## This is heading 2
### This is heading 3
#### This is heading 4
##### This is heading 5
###### This is heading 6

# Lists

```
* Unordered lists will start with asterisks
- Or with dashes
+ Or with plus signs


1. To create an ordered list, I can start lines with numbers followed by periods
    1. Indent with 4 spaces or a tab to create sub-items
    2. Use further indentation to create nested lists
        - It's possible to mix and match list types

2. Sub-lists within unordered lists will use different markers automatically:
    * Any marker can be used for the first level
    + And any marker for new sub-levels:
        * I can use asterisks
        + Or plus signs
        - Or dashes
```

# Emphasis

```
Italics: *single asterisks* or _single underscores_

Bold: **double asterisks** or __double underscores__

Combined bold and italics: **_double asterisks and single underscores_**

All bold and italic: ***triple asterisks*** or ___triple underscores___
```

# Links

```
[Example website](https://www.example.net)

[Same website with a title](https://www.example.net "Example Website")

[Link to a file in the project](./images/Max-Gripe.webp)

[Numbers can be used for reference links][1]

Or simply [text as the reference].

URLs will automatically become links: https://www.example.net or <https://www.example.net>.

... and here are some reference links defined later in the document that won't be visible in the rendered HTML:

[descriptive text]: https://www.example.net
[1]: https://www.example.net
[text as the reference]: https://www.example.net
```

# Ignoring formatting

It is possible to ignore Markdown fomatting by placing a backslash before the Markdown character.

```
For example, \*this text won't be italicized\*.

# Code blocks

```
Backticks can be used to highlight code inline, like this:

"To print "Hello, F#!" in F#, you can use the `printfn` function".

And triple backticks can be used to highlight code blocks:

﻿﻿﻿```﻿﻿﻿
let greet name =
    printfn "Hello, %s!" name

greet "F#"

﻿﻿﻿```﻿﻿﻿
```

Backticks can be used to highlight code inline, like this:

"To print "Hello, F#!" in F#, you can use the `printfn` function".

And triple backticks can be used to highlight code blocks:

```
let greet name =
    printfn "Hello, %s!" name

greet "F#"
```

# Tables

```
Tables might be my favorite feature. They are super easy to create:

| Left-Aligned | Center-Aligned | Right-Aligned |
|:-------------|:--------------:|--------------:|
| This         | This           | This          |
| column       | column         | column        |
| is           | is             | is            |
| left-aligned | center-aligned | right-aligned |
```

# Inline HTML

```
Inline HTML is partially supported. Sometimes it can be useful, for example to strikethrough text:

<del>This text will be striked through</del>.

For some reason regular strikethrough is not supported. Proof: ~~This text is not striked through~~.

That's all for now, as a start. Thank you for visiting my website. I will try to add new blog posts regularly. There might not be a lot of them, but I should be able to write something at least once a year :)

One more thing, the site has a [giscus](https://github.com/apps/giscus) comment system, so you can leave comments under each post. I will be happy to answer all questions.
