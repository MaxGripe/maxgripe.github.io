# Information as the fabric of the universe

In the Standard Model, fundamental particles are considered indivisible. However, in theoretical physics, especially in string theory, there is a hypothesis that quarks, leptons, and bosons may themselves be composed of even smaller units called "strings" - vibrating 1D entities.

In my humble opinion, the assumption that there could be something like a smallest, indivisible particle or object, or literally anything without internal structure or components, is flawed.

If we delve deeper into the micro scale, we won't find indivisible objects at the very end. Instead, we will encounter information. It is information that forms the building blocks of the universe.

Perhaps the reason we still don't have an officially accepted "Theory of Everything" is that these matters are mostly addressed by physicists accustomed to thinking in terms of particles. What we need here is a more mathematical approach.

This is where someone like Garrett Lisi and his E8 Theory comes into play. Some physicists dismiss his theory as a "mathematical exercise" with no grounding in reality. But if we assume that the universe's foundation is information rather than particles, then it might actually be the traditional "physical" theories that appear as peculiar exercises detached from reality.

TLDR: I believe the fundamental building block of the universe is purely information, and the E8 theory, rooted in a mathematical framework, seems highly plausible to me.
